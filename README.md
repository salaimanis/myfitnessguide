## 📅 Program Phases Overview

The 12-week transformation is structured into three active phases, followed by a maintenance phase:

| Phase | Duration  | Key Focus             | Est. Daily Calories | Target Est. Loss |
| :---- | :-------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
| 1     | Weeks 1-4 | Fat Loss Foundation   | ~2100 kcal          | 5-6kg            |
| 2     | Weeks 5-8 | Strength Building     | ~2200 kcal          | 4-5kg            |
| 3     | Weeks 9-12| Shredding & Definition| ~2000 kcal          | 3-4kg            |
| 4     | Ongoing   | Maintenance           | ~2400 kcal          | Maintain         |

*Note: Calorie targets are estimates based on the original user profile. **Adjust calories based on your calculated TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and consult a nutritionist.** Target loss figures are also estimates and individual results will vary.*

## 🔬 Science-Backed Approach

This program integrates evidence-based principles for effective and safer results:

* **Fat Loss:** Utilizes a moderate caloric deficit (~30% below maintenance) combined with high protein intake (around 2.0g/kg bodyweight) to preserve muscle mass during fat loss, referencing principles outlined by Helms et al. (2014) in nutrient timing and macronutrient distribution.
* **Skin Elasticity:** Suggests daily intake of 10g hydrolyzed collagen peptides paired with Vitamin C to potentially support skin health during weight loss, based on studies like Proksch et al. (2014) on collagen's effects on skin.
* **Workout Structure:** Employs a Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) split, a common and effective routine for promoting muscle hypertrophy and strength gains, as supported by research synthesized by Schoenfeld (2016) on resistance training variables.
* **Resourceful Adaptation:** Encourages referencing established guidelines for safe exercise and weight management:
    * [ACSM Exercise Guidelines](https://www.acsm.org/education-resources/trending-topics-resources/physical-activity-guidelines)
    * [NIH Weight Management Resources](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management)
    * [ISSN Nutrition Guides](https://www.nutritionissn.com/positions) (Check for relevant position stands)

    * **For Older Adults (50+):** Prioritize longer warm-ups (10-15 mins), incorporate more mobility exercises, and aim for slightly higher protein intake (e.g., ~1.6g/kg bodyweight or as advised by a professional) to support muscle maintenance.
